# ML_CustomerChurn


### Develop an understanding of the project

Customer churn also is known as the loss of clients or customers. The companies use customer churn rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. 

**Acquiring new customers is essential, but retaining them accelerates profitable growth**

I have been tasked to provide information that may help in achieving two priorities.

  1) understanding unhappy customers ("Why are they unhappy? Who are they ?")
  2) Predict the probability of a dissatisfied customer.
